In a team meet, everytime a group of N people were called in which Rajat Gupta was called everytime as he consider himself as the peak member. All the members were represented by index (0 - based).

The peak was at different indexes everytime when a group is called. The task is to identify the index of the peak element.

Peak element is the element which is strictly greater than its adjacent elements
